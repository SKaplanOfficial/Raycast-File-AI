PromptLab is a Raycast extension for creating powerful, contextually-aware AI commands using placeholders, action scripts, and more.

PromptLab allows you to create custom AI commands with prompts that utilize contextual placeholders such as {{selectedText}}, {{todayEvents}}, or {{currentApplication}} to vastly expand the capabilities of Raycast AI. PromptLab can also extract information from selected files, if you choose, so that it can tell you about the subjects in an image, summarize a PDF, and more.

PromptLab also supports "action scripts" -- AppleScripts which run with the AI's response as input. This opens a whole new world of capabilities such as allowing the AI to generate and modify files.
